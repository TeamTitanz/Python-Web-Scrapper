S. C. section 1 et seq., is reversed because a court may not issue a blanket refusal to compel arbitration under the Act merely on the grounds that some of the claims could be resolved by the court without arbitration, and therefore, the appeals court's failure to determine whether the balance of respondents' claims were arbitrable was erroneous."}
